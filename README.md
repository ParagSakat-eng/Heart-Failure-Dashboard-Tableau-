# Heart-Failure-Dashboard-Tableau-

## üìò Project Description
This **Tableau dashboard** visualizes a **Heart Failure Clinical Records dataset**, focusing on patient survival analysis based on health conditions, biomarkers, and lifestyle factors. It highlights key medical parameters that influence survival outcomes in heart failure patients.  

# ‚úÖ Key Highlights
To analyze patient survival and mortality factors in heart failure cases by exploring relationships between:  
- Demographics (Age, Sex)  
- Clinical conditions (Diabetes, Anemia, Hypertension, Smoking)  
- Biomarkers (Platelets, Creatinine, Sodium, Creatine Phosphokinase)  
- Ejection Fraction & Serum Creatinine  

# ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: 
- This is not official medical data. It is a **sample dataset** used for visualization and educational purposes only.  
  
## üìÅ Dataset Used
Sample **Heart Failure Dataset** containing 299 patients with attributes:  
- Age, Sex  
- Anaemia, Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Smoking  
- Platelets, Serum Creatinine, Serum Sodium  
- Ejection Fraction  
- Time (Follow-up period in days)  
- Death Event (1 = Died, 0 = Survived)

## ‚ùì Questions Answered (KPIs)
- What percentage of patients survived vs died?  
- How do **anemia, hypertension, diabetes, smoking** impact survival?  
- Which **age groups** are most vulnerable?  
- How do **lab values (sodium, creatinine, platelets)** relate to survival?  
- What role does **ejection fraction** play in outcomes?  
- How do survival rates differ by **sex**?

## ‚öôÔ∏è Process
1. Imported dataset into Tableau.  
2. Cleaned and standardized patient records.  
3. Built visualizations:  
   - Donut Charts (Health Conditions vs Survival)  
   - Box Plots (Age vs Survival by Gender)  
   - Scatter Plots (Age-Time, Biomarkers vs Survival)  
   - Histograms (Age, Platelets, Creatinine, Sodium)  

## üîç Project Insights
- Out of **299 patients**, **96 died** and **203 survived**.  
- **Males** had slightly higher survival rates (44.15%) compared to females.  
- **High serum creatinine and low ejection fraction** strongly correlated with mortality.  
- **Older patients (60+)** showed higher death rates.  
- **Hypertension, diabetes, and anemia** were significant risk factors but not as critical as **ejection fraction**.
- 
## ‚úÖ Final Conclusion
The dashboard highlights **key clinical predictors** of survival in heart failure patients. Ejection fraction and serum creatinine are the most influential markers. This tool can assist medical researchers and practitioners in identifying high-risk patients.
